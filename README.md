## The Story
You are a plant enthusiast who wants to open your own plant conservatory. You recently acquired this old greenhouse and must add new plants to it by discovering new plants in the world around you and displaying them. Along the way, you meet fun, but sometimes odd, local residents who may help or hinder you in your quest to find new plants.
